			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<p>
				I am currently studying the brain and the autonomic nervous system. Specifically,
				my research focuses on the connection between the brain and the heart and how it relates
				to mental fatigue.
			</p>

			<p>
				I am also interested in teleological questions in physiology, such as why
				fatigue, neural connectivity, and regulation exist in the first place.
			</p>

			<p>
				I develop games both inside and outside of research, including a recent
				biosignal-controlled rhythm game designed for accessibility.
			</p>

			<!-- <p> -->
			<!-- 	Outside of work, I enjoy listening to and making experimental electronic music and -->
			<!-- 	jazzy hip-hop beats, as well as creating digital audio-reactive art. -->
